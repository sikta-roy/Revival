The platform aims to bridge geographical healthcare disparities, providing quality medical advice remotely and enhancing healthcare accessibility.

Project Installation:
The project was mainly done in replit and some parts are done in VS Code.
We used PHP and Google Excel Sheets as our main backend and database for our signup and login system.
XAMPP was used to locally host the login part of the website.

We tried using Nodejs, Expressjs, and MongoDB to implement the appointment part in our website.
Commands used :
npm i express
npm i mongoose
